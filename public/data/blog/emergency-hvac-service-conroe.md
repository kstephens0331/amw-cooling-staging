## What Qualifies as an HVAC Emergency?

Not every breakdown requires after-hours service. A true HVAC emergency involves one or more of these factors:

**Immediate Health and Safety Risks**
- Carbon monoxide exposure from a malfunctioning furnace
- Electrical hazards like smoking, sparking, or burning smells
- Gas leaks near HVAC equipment
- Extreme indoor temperatures threatening vulnerable family members

**Potential Property Damage**
- Water leaks that could damage flooring, ceilings, or walls
- Frozen pipes due to heating system failure
- Refrigerant leaks that could harm people or pets

**Extreme Discomfort During Dangerous Weather**
- No air conditioning during heat waves (100°+ temperatures)
- No heat during freezing weather (below 40°F outdoor temps)
- Complete system failure during severe weather events

If your situation involves any of these scenarios, **don't wait—call AMW Cooling & Heating immediately at (936) 331-1339**.

## Critical Warning Signs That Require Immediate Action

### 1. Complete Loss of Heating or Cooling During Extreme Weather

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Outdoor temperatures above 95°F with no AC (especially with elderly family members or infants)
- Outdoor temperatures below 40°F with no heat
- Forecast showing conditions worsening in the next 12-24 hours

**Why It Matters:**
Heat exhaustion and hypothermia are real dangers. Texas heat can push indoor temps above 100°F within hours, while North Houston cold snaps can drop indoor temperatures dangerously low overnight.

**What to Do:**
**Call us immediately at (936) 331-1339.** While waiting for our technician:
- Move vulnerable family members to a safe location (friend's house, cooling center, etc.)
- Close blinds and curtains to block heat
- Use fans or space heaters as temporary measures (never leave space heaters unattended)

### 2. Burning Smells or Visible Smoke

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Smoke coming from vents, furnace, or outdoor AC unit
- Strong burning plastic or electrical smell
- Burning dust smell that doesn't dissipate after 15 minutes

**Why It Matters:**
Electrical fires can start inside HVAC equipment and spread rapidly. Even if you don't see flames, smoldering wires can ignite at any moment.

**What to Do:**
1. **Turn off your HVAC system immediately** at the thermostat and breaker
2. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339**—do not attempt repairs yourself
3. If you see flames or heavy smoke, evacuate and call 911

### 3. Gas Smell Near Your Furnace

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Any noticeable natural gas odor (smells like rotten eggs or sulfur)
- Gas smell that gets stronger near your HVAC equipment
- Hissing sounds near gas lines

**Why It Matters:**
Natural gas leaks can cause explosions and carbon monoxide poisoning. This is the most dangerous HVAC emergency.

**What to Do:**
1. **Do NOT turn any switches on or off, including lights**
2. **Do NOT use phones or electronics inside the home**
3. **Evacuate immediately and call 911 from outside**
4. **Call your gas company's emergency line**
5. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339** after the gas company secures the scene

### 4. Carbon Monoxide Alarm Activation

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Carbon monoxide detector sounds an alarm
- Family members experiencing symptoms: headache, dizziness, nausea, confusion (especially if symptoms improve when leaving the house)

**Why It Matters:**
Carbon monoxide is an invisible, odorless killer. Gas furnaces with cracked heat exchangers are a common source.

**What to Do:**
1. **Evacuate everyone immediately**
2. **Call 911**
3. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339** for emergency furnace inspection and repair once it's safe to return

### 5. Water Leaking from Indoor HVAC Equipment

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Substantial water pooling around your indoor unit
- Water dripping from ceiling vents or through walls
- Continuous water flow that doesn't stop when system is off

**Why It Matters:**
Water damage to flooring, drywall, and ceiling materials can cost thousands to repair. Mold can begin growing within 24-48 hours in humid Conroe conditions.

**What to Do:**
1. **Turn off your HVAC system**
2. **Place towels/buckets to catch water**
3. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339** for emergency service
4. **Document damage with photos** for insurance if needed

### 6. Frozen AC Coils or Ice Buildup

**When It's an Emergency:**
- Ice completely covering your outdoor unit or indoor coil
- Ice visible on refrigerant lines
- System running constantly but not cooling

**Why It Matters:**
Running a frozen system can destroy your compressor—a $2,000-$4,000 repair. Ice also indicates refrigerant leaks, electrical problems, or severe airflow restriction.

**What to Do:**
1. **Turn off your AC immediately**
2. **Turn the fan to "ON" (not AUTO)** to help thaw the ice
3. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339**—don't restart the system until we inspect it

## Urgent (But Not Emergency) Situations

Some HVAC problems need prompt attention but aren't true emergencies:

**Call for Next-Day Service When:**
- System isn't cooling or heating adequately (but still running)
- Strange noises that weren't present before
- Thermostat not responding or displaying errors
- System short-cycling (turning on and off repeatedly)
- Higher than normal energy bills with reduced performance
- Weak airflow from some vents

**Schedule these for regular business hours by calling (936) 331-1339 or [booking online](/contact-us).** We typically have same-day or next-day availability for urgent repairs.

## Preventing HVAC Emergencies: What Conroe Homeowners Should Know

Most HVAC emergencies are preventable with proper maintenance and early intervention:

### Fall and Spring Tune-Ups

**[Schedule preventive maintenance](/contact-us)** twice yearly—before summer cooling season and before winter heating season. During these visits, AMW technicians:

- Inspect heat exchangers for cracks (prevents carbon monoxide leaks)
- Test safety controls and shut-offs
- Clean or replace air filters
- Check refrigerant levels
- Inspect electrical connections
- Lubricate moving parts
- Test system startup and shutdown sequences

**Cost:** $79-$129 per visit
**Savings:** Prevents 80% of emergency breakdowns and extends equipment life by years

### Warning Signs to Never Ignore

Don't wait for complete failure. **Call AMW at (936) 331-1339** if you notice:

- Rising energy bills without increased usage
- Rooms that won't reach desired temperatures
- Unusual sounds (grinding, squealing, banging)
- Moisture or rust around HVAC equipment
- Frequent breaker trips when HVAC runs
- Age: systems over 15 years old failing more frequently

### Filter Changes

**Change your air filter every 30-60 days during heavy use seasons.** Clogged filters cause:
- Frozen coils

## Emergency HVAC Service Costs: What to Expect

Emergency service typically costs more than regular business hours service due to after-hours labor rates:

**Emergency Service Call Fee:** $150-$250
This covers diagnosis and trip charges. If you proceed with repairs, this fee is often credited toward the repair cost.

**Repair Costs:** Vary based on the problem
- Minor repairs (capacitor, thermostat, filter): $200-$500
- Moderate repairs (motor, control board, contactor): $400-$1,200
- Major repairs (compressor, heat exchanger): $1,500-$4,000+

**We always provide pricing before beginning work.** No repairs happen without your approval.

**Payment Options:**
- Cash, check, credit cards accepted
- Financing available for major repairs
- Many homeowners insurance policies cover emergency HVAC repairs

## Temporary Measures While Waiting for Emergency Service

If you're waiting for our technician, here are safe temporary solutions:

**For Cooling Emergencies:**
- Close blinds/curtains to block heat
- Use ceiling or box fans (costs less than AC)
- Stay hydrated
- Move to coolest room in house
- Avoid using ovens or heat-generating appliances

**For Heating Emergencies:**
- Close off unused rooms to concentrate heat
- Use space heaters safely (never unattended, away from combustibles)
- Reverse ceiling fans to push warm air down
- Block drafts under doors with towels
- Dress in layers

**Never:**
- Use gas ovens or stovetops for heat (carbon monoxide risk)
- Run generators indoors (deadly carbon monoxide)
- Use multiple high-wattage space heaters on one circuit (fire hazard)
- Attempt DIY repairs on gas or electrical systems

---

## When to Consider System Replacement vs. Emergency Repair

Sometimes emergency repairs don't make financial sense. Consider replacement if:

- Your system is over 15 years old AND
- Repair costs exceed 50% of replacement cost AND
- Your system has had multiple repairs in recent years

**AMW provides honest recommendations.** If replacement makes more sense than repair, we'll explain why and provide options. Many homeowners choose replacement during emergencies to avoid future breakdowns.

**Financing available:** We offer payment plans that make emergency replacements affordable.
