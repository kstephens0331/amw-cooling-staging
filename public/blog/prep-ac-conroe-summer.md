Beyond filters, outdoor units deserve attention long before summer is in full swing. It’s common to see condenser units in backyards surrounded by tall grass, weeds, or decorative shrubs. While landscaping adds curb appeal, it also strangles airflow when vegetation grows too close. The fan inside the condenser is designed to push heat out efficiently, but even partial blockages force the compressor to work overtime. Overheating can shorten the lifespan of the system dramatically. Clearing a two-to-three-foot radius around the unit with nothing but open air is one of the easiest ways to help your AC breathe.

Another area that many Conroe homeowners miss is ductwork. Our climate means ducts often run through hot attics, and even small leaks or poor insulation lead to massive energy losses. Imagine paying to cool the attic instead of the living room—it happens more often than you’d think. A thorough inspection can reveal gaps, cracks, or poorly sealed connections that leak conditioned air before it ever reaches your vents. Sealing and insulating ductwork not only improves comfort in every room but can reduce energy bills by as much as 20 percent. In The Woodlands and Spring, where two-story homes are common, duct efficiency makes the difference between upstairs bedrooms being livable or sweltering.

Thermostats, too, are often ignored until they fail. In older Conroe homes, mechanical thermostats still exist, but upgrading to programmable or smart thermostats provides better control and efficiency. A well-programmed thermostat allows you to keep the home comfortable when you’re there while reducing output during work hours or vacations. Smart thermostats go further, learning your habits and adjusting automatically while providing energy reports so you can see exactly how your system is performing. Given how much electricity air conditioners consume in Texas summers, these upgrades typically pay for themselves within one or two seasons.

Professional maintenance, however, remains the most critical preparation step. At AMW Cooling & Heating LLC, we encourage homeowners to schedule a tune-up before May, when the first heat waves hit and demand for service skyrockets. During a tune-up, our technicians check refrigerant levels, clean coils, inspect electrical connections, test motors, and verify airflow. Catching low refrigerant before summer avoids frozen coils and weak cooling. Identifying frayed wires or failing capacitors before they blow prevents sudden shutdowns. We’ve had countless calls in July where a simple capacitor replacement could have been handled months earlier during a routine inspection. Preventive maintenance transforms emergencies into minor adjustments, keeping you comfortable when others are sweating through service delays.

Humidity is another uniquely Texan challenge. Even if your thermostat reads 72 degrees, high humidity makes it feel far hotter indoors. Conroe’s proximity to Lake Conroe and the Piney Woods means moisture hangs heavy in the air all summer long. If your AC isn’t managing humidity effectively, it may be undersized, oversized, or simply in need of maintenance. Oversized systems cool air quickly but don’t run long enough to dehumidify properly, while undersized units run endlessly and still can’t keep up. Solutions may include adjusting system size, adding whole-home dehumidifiers, or balancing airflow throughout the house. Proper humidity control doesn’t just improve comfort; it protects wood floors, furniture, and even drywall from moisture damage.

Another issue that often arises is power surges. Summer thunderstorms in Montgomery County can knock out power or cause surges that damage sensitive HVAC electronics. Surge protectors designed for HVAC units are inexpensive compared to replacing control boards or thermostats. We recommend installing one as part of your spring prep checklist.

The financial benefits of preparing your AC early are impossible to ignore. Energy bills in Conroe and The Woodlands often spike 30–40 percent during summer months. A clean, well-maintained, and properly tuned system reduces that burden significantly. Think of preparation as an investment: a $59 seasonal tune-up could save you hundreds in energy costs and thousands in avoided repairs or premature replacement.

Beyond money and comfort, there’s also peace of mind. Families in Conroe know the discomfort of a house heating up rapidly when the AC fails at night or over a weekend. Waiting for emergency service when dozens of other households are calling at the same time can mean hours—or even days—of unbearable conditions. Preparing now ensures your home remains a refuge instead of a sauna.

It’s worth noting that air conditioning is more than just comfort in Texas—it can be a health issue. For seniors, young children, and those with respiratory conditions, a working AC system is essential. High heat combined with humidity raises the risk of heat exhaustion and heatstroke, even indoors. Clean filters and good air circulation also reduce allergens, improving respiratory health during pollen-heavy months.
