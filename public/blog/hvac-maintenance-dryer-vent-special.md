Fall in Conroe, The Woodlands, and surrounding Montgomery County means cooler nights, the start of holiday planning, and—if you’re like most homeowners—turning attention back indoors. It’s the season when your HVAC system transitions from cooling to heating, and it’s also the perfect time to tackle hidden fire hazards in your home.

That’s why this month, **AMW Cooling & Heating is offering a limited-time special: purchase a maintenance plan, and receive a FREE dryer vent inspection and cleaning.** This bundle not only saves you money, it protects your family, improves efficiency, and ensures peace of mind all season long.

## Why HVAC Maintenance Matters in the Fall

### Transitioning from Cooling to Heating
Texas summers put strain on your air conditioning system, and as temperatures cool down, your furnace or heat pump steps in to keep your home warm. After months of inactivity, your heating system needs a professional tune-up to ensure it can handle the season ahead.

### Key Benefits of HVAC Maintenance
- **Efficiency Gains**: A clean, tuned system can lower energy use by 10–20%.  
- **Extended Lifespan**: Routine care prevents premature breakdowns.  
- **Improved Comfort**: Balanced airflow means consistent heating throughout your home.  
- **Safety First**: Inspections catch carbon monoxide risks, electrical wear, and other hazards before they escalate.

## The Hidden Danger of Dryer Vents

While HVAC maintenance is essential, the real surprise for many homeowners is the condition of their dryer vents. According to the National Fire Protection Association, **thousands of home fires every year are caused by clogged dryer vents**.

### Warning Signs You Need Cleaning
- Clothes take longer to dry.  
- The dryer feels excessively hot.  
- A burning smell occurs during operation.  
- Lint and debris are visible around the vent opening.  

### Why Cleaning Matters
- Prevents dangerous lint buildup that can ignite.  
- Saves money by reducing drying times.  
- Extends the life of your dryer.  
- Improves indoor air quality by venting moisture properly.
